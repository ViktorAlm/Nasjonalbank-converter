###Converts nasjonalbiblioteks spr√•kbank 16khz dataset into libirispeech format

This is a hack that i created with the intention of never showing anyone. Its javscripty python with random weirdness thrown into it. I am ashamed.

The extracted folders from Swedish and Norwegian has different naming conventions. The 0467 for Swedish is a dataset ID like 0463 is for Norwegian. This name id is repeated within the folder structures. Theres an adb folder which has the id in it. I grab the ID from the main folder name, but since the name of the folders follow a different naming convention i suggest renaming either of them into one naming convention and choosing the default parameter of

```python
def openFolderStations(folder, data, wavs, spls, lang="swe"):
```

to swe or no depending of which format you choose

swe:
```
"0467 sv train 1/", "0467 sv train 2/", "0467 sv train 3/", "0468 sv test/"
```
```
no:
"no.16khz.0463-1/", "no.16khz.0463-2/", "no.16khz.0463-3/", "no.16khz.0463-4/", "no.16khz.0464-testing/"]
```
Run it in the same path as the folders. The paths works on ubuntu. This has no fancy threading. 1 core to rule them all.
